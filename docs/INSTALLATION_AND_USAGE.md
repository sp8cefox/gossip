# Installation and Usage

## Installation

See [Installation](INSTALLATION.md) for available packages and building from source options.

## Configuration

See [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for configuration.

## Command Line Usage

Gossip is a GUI desktop program, but it also outputs a lot of messages to the console as it runs. I recommend you keep the console open and pay some attention to errors or other odd behavior that may become apparent from the console messages.

Gossip has a lot of command line commands for tweaking things or extracting bits of information from its database.

See [Gossip Commands](COMMANDS.md)

## Troubleshooting

See [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
