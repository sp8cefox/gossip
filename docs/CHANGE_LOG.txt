0.11.0
======

This release adds the following major features:

* SECURE DIRECT MESSAGING:  NIP-17 DMs (with NIP-44 encryption and NIP-59
  Giftwrap) is fully supported, usable only if both parties have published
  their DM relays in a kind 10050 event. You will get a pending item reminding
  you to setup your DM relays if you haven't yet. Relays now have DM switches.

* LOAD MORE: now loads a fixed count of events, instead of a time period (which
  may have been empty or may have been massive).

* ANNOTATIONS: You may now annotate your messages. If you make a typo, your
  annotation (technically a reply event) will render inside the original message
  in gossip (but will render as a reply in other clients).

Fixes you may notice:

* Fixed around list synchronization
* Fixes around the tagging popup UI/UX
* Improvements in loading thread ancestors, including better feedback
* Nip46 approvals now persist
* Nip46 compatibility improvements
* An event ordering issue was fixed

Additionally:

* Support for wgpu renderer, and new command to set renderer: wgpu_renderer
* Option to render feed in reverse (with newest at the bottom)
* Improved local storage performance
* Fixes around switching feeds and refreshing
* Vertical scroll bar on relay options
* fixed deleting lists
* Thai font is now also supported in the 'lang-cjk' feature
* Blacklisted relay.nostr.band and filter.nostr.wine relay URLs with proliferating path issues
* k tag added to deletion events
* When querying events, we also query their possible deletion events
* Avoid accidently asking for DMs because some relays reject that subscription
* Avoid repeated AUTHs to broken relays that keep asking
* Improvements around which relays we post to
* Improvements about relay connections
* New commands: export_encrypted_key, import_encrypted_private_key
* UI/UX updates to notifications
* Setting for custom mouse acceleration
* Allow DPI setting up to 400
* UI/UX improvements to widgets and styles
* Updates to dependencies
* Render unknown event kinds better
* Lots more, see changelog-0.11.0.txt for all commit messages


0.10.1

0.10.0
======

This rThis release adds the following major features:

* Nostr Connect signer: Gossip can now serve as your private key bunker using NIP-46.
* Whitelist support for relays: Optionally gossip can refuse to connect or authenticate to
  relays until you approve (or deny) such connections. For some, this is the privacy they
  need to accept the outbox model.
* SpamSafe: When enabled, gossip will not fetch replies from people you don't follow except
  from relays that you designate as SpamSafe. This helps eliminate spam.
* Load More: At the bottom of the feed, you can press Load More to load more. Be aware that
  this is currently based on fixed time windows, not a fixed count of events.
* Advertising your relay list now automatically selects relays to advertise to.
* The Onboarding Wizard has many improvements
* Pending Actions: We now detect and alert you to things you probably should do, like keeping
  lists in sync.

Additionally:
* Better handling of relay error conditions and reconnections
* Better handling of switching between online and offline as well as shutting down
* Improvements to seeking thread ancestors
* Improvements to seeking notes by id and author (via the author's relay lists)
* egui update bringing global cut-and-paste as well as other UX improvements.
* Option to retry posting an event to relays it failed to post to earlier ('post again').
* Can start gossip in offline mode now with a checkbox on the login screen
* Person-list desynchronization detection fixes
* AppImage and Flatpak releases
* Security fix: RUSTSEC-2023-0065
* Privacy fix: images are not shown in DMs until the user approves
* MANY more fixes and improvements that are too numerious to listelease adds the following major features:
